### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Danny Monareng and living in South Africa. 
I started having an interest in learning software developement from around March this year. During that time, it was still lock-down restrictions with limited movement. I saw this as an opportunity to learn a new skill since I had a lot of time in my hands.
I did not have any previous coding experience, however I was further inspired by Microverse on Instagram, whereby they advertised to be offering traing even to those without previous experience in this field.

It was then that I started to venture into their precourse training which was for basic javascript, then later CSS and towards the end HTML and how they ultimately compliment each other in web development.

Currently I am at a stage whereby I must do web development trials through peer to peer collaboration with other learners.

However I opted to come and sharpen my technical skills on Github Opensource projects. This will hopefully provide an opportunity to work with others software developers, and to further gain by learning more skills and to hopefully contribute in one way or the other in real life project

Today I completed my first training on introduction to GitHub and at first was a bit intimidating but exciting at the end.

I lastly I hope to meet and interact with others developers in the community of the platform on matters where guidance and help is needed.
